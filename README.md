# AkriData Python Client Examples


Welcome to the AkriData Python Client (akride) Examples repository. This repository contains examples demonstrating how to use the AkriData Python client (akride) to interact with the AkriData's Data Explorer platform.  **akride** allows you to seamlessly integrate AkriData's powerful data management capabilities into your Python applications.


## Getting Started

To get started with the Python client, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Sign Up for an AkriData Account

### Step 2: Obtain the SDK Config

1. Sign in to the AkriData Data Explorer UI using your newly created account credentials.

2. Navigate to the "Utilities" section.

3. Select "Get CLI/SDK config."

4. You will receive the SDK configuration that is needed to interact with AkriData's services. Make sure to keep this configuration file secure.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

#### Prerequisites

- Python version 3.8 or higher is required to run the examples in this repository.
- We recommend using a virtual environment to manage your Python dependencies.

Once you have followed the steps in the previous section, clone this repository. Once you have the SDK configuration, you can start using the client to interact with AkriData's Data Explorer platform.

## Notebooks


1. **Data Ingestion and Exploration** - [View Notebook](notebooks/akride_explore_dataset.ipynb)

   This notebook provides an example of how to ingest data into the AkriData Data Explorer application using the Python client. It shows how the client can be used to explore image data, run similarity searches, and create result sets within the AkriData platform.

   _Note: Make sure to follow the "Getting Started" steps to set up your environment and obtain the necessary SDK configuration before running this notebook._
